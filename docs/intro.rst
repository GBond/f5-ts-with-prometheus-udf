Welcome Page For Your Docs!
==============================================

This template contains the minimum necessary files and folder structure to build documentation based on `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`__ documentation generation tool. It uses `reStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`__ markup language to modify the text as you see it on this page. 
Clone this repository using SourceTree as the Git client, modify the content, then change the origin to your own new remote (on GitHub) repository that will manage your own content. 

Why Documentation?
-------------------
- Ensure consistency and efficiency
     - Reduce RFx and PoC time

     - hands on lab, training, workshop, etc
     - Share tribal knowledge

.. NOTE::
   F5 Official document sites will remain the source of truth. Documentation you create on Read the Docs will be supplementary and mainly for specific purposes like hands-on training and workshops.
