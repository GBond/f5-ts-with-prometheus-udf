Module 1: Confirm and Commit Changes from Sourcetree
===========================

You will commit changes to your repository, which will trigger a build on Read the Docs.

#. Click **Stage All** to prepare them for commit. Then type in a comment in the comment box describing the changes, check **Push changes immediately to origin/master**, then click Commit to apply the changes to your GitHub repository.
